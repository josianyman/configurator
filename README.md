This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### Download tools if not exists
1. Download `nvm` tool for Node version manager
2. Open terminal in the root of the project and run in the terminal `nvm install` to install the correct Node version specified in the `.nvmrc` file

## Start locally for live development

```bash
# Install the required `node_modules` libraries
nmp install
# Start live development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
